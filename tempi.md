- Research how to transform a web app into a mobile application and publish it on Play Store/App Store.

**Day 5-7: Initial Setup**
- Set up the development environment.
- Create the basic structure of the app.
- Set up version control (e.g., Git).

### Week 2: Core Functionalities
**Day 8-10: Token System and API**
- Implement the token system for payments.

### Additional Notes:
- **Francesco's Role**: Ensure Francesco is involved in the design phase, especially from Day 18-19 and Day 25-26.
- **Cloud Services**: Decide on the cloud services (Paas and Saas) early in the project, ideally during the research phase.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure all features comply with GDPR norms throughout the development process.

This timeline is quite aggressive, so it's crucial to stay focused and communicate effectively within the team. Adjustments may be needed based on progress and any unforeseen challenges.
